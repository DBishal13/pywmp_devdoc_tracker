## Abstract
This paper presents a novel GPU-accelerated implementation of Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR), a spatial statistical method that models spatially varying relationships at multiple scales. Building on our previous work with FastGWR, we leverage the parallel processing capabilities of modern GPUs to overcome computational challenges that have limited the application of MGWR to large datasets. Our implementation achieves significant speedup compared to CPU-based approaches while maintaining numerical accuracy. Performance evaluations using Zillow housing data demonstrate that the GPU-MGWR implementation enables the analysis of datasets with hundreds of thousands of observations, previously impractical with existing tools. We discuss the algorithmic innovations necessary for efficient GPU implementation and demonstrate how this computational advancement enables new insights in spatial analysis. Our approach makes sophisticated spatial modeling accessible for big spatial data applications, opening new possibilities for understanding complex spatial processes.
